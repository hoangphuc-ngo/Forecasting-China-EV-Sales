## Overview

China is the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) market, accounting for over half of global EV sales annually. Accurate monthly sales forecasting is critical for production planning, battery procurement, charging infrastructure deployment, and policy evaluation.

This project constructs a rigorous SARIMA forecasting workflow applied to a 76-month monthly EV sales panel. The key methodological contribution is a **two-stage model selection procedure** — BIC-guided auto-ARIMA followed by **nested rolling cross-validation** — which produces a more robust and generalisable model than single-split evaluation. Five baseline models (non-seasonal ARIMA, Holt-Winters, Prophet, LSTM, and a log-space SARIMA) are benchmarked on the same hold-out window.

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Final model** | $\text{SARIMA}(1,1,0) \times (1,1,0)_{12}$ |
| **Test MAPE** | 17.42 % |
| **Test RMSE** | 108,617 units |
| **Ljung-Box** $Q(12)$ $p$-value | 0.336 (white-noise residuals ✓) |
| **Dec 2024 peak forecast** | ~810,000 units |
| **Feb 2025 trough forecast** | ~446,000 units |

- The model **outperforms non-seasonal ARIMA and LSTM** and is **competitive with Holt-Winters** across both RMSE and MAPE.
- An **additive specification on the original scale** substantially outperforms log-space (multiplicative) alternatives, due to the post-subsidy structural break in 2023.
- Strong **Q4 seasonality** (year-end peak) and **Q1 trough** (Lunar New Year) are captured reliably.

## Dataset

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Source** | [China Automobile Monthly Sales Data (2018–2024.4)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felixzhao/china-automobile-monthly-sales-data-2018-2024-4) — Felixzhao on Kaggle |
| **Compiled from** | China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) official registration records |
| **Raw records** | 38,806 vehicle-model-month observations |
| **Fields** | `year_month`, `units_sold`, `brand`, `model`, `is_ev`, `body_type`, `brand_country` |
| **Processed series** | 76 monthly EV sales totals, Jan 2018 – Apr 2024 |
| **Range** | 8,988 units (Feb 2020, COVID lockdown) → 755,943 units (Dec 2023) |

**Preprocessing steps:** deduplication (33 rows removed), type conversion, EV filtering (`is_ev == "EV"`), monthly aggregation, monthly-start frequency alignment.

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Time series visualisation revealing three structural phases: slow growth (2018–2020), explosive acceleration (2021–2022), post-subsidy stabilisation (2023–2024).
- Additive seasonal decomposition (12-month period): stable seasonal amplitude ±75,000 units; Jan 2023 post-subsidy outlier confirmed at 3σ.
- Additive vs. multiplicative decomposition comparison.

### 2. Stationarity Testing
- **ADF** and **KPSS** dual testing on raw and differenced series.
- Selected differencing: $d = 1$, $D = 1$, $s = 12$ (confirmed stationary by both tests simultaneously).

### 3. Two-Stage Model Selection

**Stage 1 — Auto-ARIMA (BIC):** Stepwise grid search over $p, q \le 2$, $P, Q \le 1$ using `pmdarima`. BIC selected as criterion to penalise over-parameterisation (64 training observations).

**Stage 2 — Nested Rolling Cross-Validation:** Expanding-window CV (step = 1, horizon = 1) refitting auto-ARIMA at each fold. Specification with lowest mean RMSE across all folds is selected as the final model.

### 4. Diagnostics & Benchmarking
- Residual ACF, histogram, Q-Q plot, and Ljung-Box $Q(12)$ test.
- Robustness check: additive (original scale) vs. multiplicative (log-space) SARIMA.
- Benchmarks: Non-seasonal ARIMA, Holt-Winters (ETS), Prophet, LSTM (32 units, lookback = 24).

### 5. Forward Forecast
- Model re-estimated on all 76 observations; 12-month forecast (May 2024 – Apr 2025) with 95% prediction intervals.

## Model Performance

### Test Set Comparison (May 2023 – Apr 2024)

| Model | RMSE (units) | MAPE (%) |
|---|---|---|
| **SARIMA$(1,1,0)\times(1,1,0)_{12}$ (Nested CV)** | 108,617 | **17.42** |
| Holt-Winters (ETS, additive) | **97,746** | 17.25 |
| Prophet | 119,070 | 18.45 |
| LSTM (lookback = 24) | 138,427 | 22.99 |
| ARIMA (non-seasonal) | 142,781 | 21.29 |

### Additive vs. Multiplicative and Log vs. No-log (Robustness Check)

| Specification | Test RMSE | Test MAPE (%) |
|---|---|---|
| SARIMA — no-log (Nested CV)  | 108,617 | **17.42** |
| SARIMA — no-log (Auto-ARIMA) | 140,031 | 25.28 |
| SARIMA — log-space (Auto-ARIMA) | 146,423 | 27.14 |
| SARIMA — log-space (Nested CV) | 146,423 | 27.14 |
| ETS — Additive | 97,746 | 17.25 |
| ETS — Multiplicative | 147,854 | 26.57 |

> The log-space model learns the pre-2023 high-growth trajectory and over-extrapolates beyond the structural break, compounding errors upon back-transformation.
